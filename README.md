# COVID-19 surveillence

This app was a result of an exploratory and statistical analysis from the number of new Covid-19 cases in brazilian states. Our initial idea was to use Bayesian inference to estimate the disease transmittion rate (R) in each brazilian state, to provide epidemiological surveillence. 
Ths app was created as part of the MIT COVID-19 Challenge | Latin America vs. COVID-19.

To run the app: 
# Create env
`conda env create -f environment.yml`

# Activate env
`conda activate mit-covid`

# Run app
`streamlit run teste.py`
